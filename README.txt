This is realization of Residual tree - data structure I invented

Current TODO's
- Implement tree such that it can contain any objects and position in the tree will be determined by it's hash code  
- Find appropriate hash function
- Implement simple numbers generator
- Use Long or BigInt for keys

Let me know if I'm not the first who invented such data structure
